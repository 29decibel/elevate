            <h3 class="md-headline"># Starting from Training Impulses</h3>

            It all begins with your heart rate training stress, also known as "training impulse" or TRIMP (TRaining
            IMPulse) first developed by Dr. Eric W. Banister. Basically, it represents the amount of heart stress during an activity: the longer you go at full
            throttle during an activity, the more TRIMP of activity goes up!

            <div ng-show="showMathsFormula" style="background: #f3f3f3; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

            </div>

            TRIMP has both a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is called "fitness", and the negative
            effect is called "fatigue".
            <br/><br/>
            "Fitness" and "fatigue" can combined to provide a value of "form/performance".

            <h3 class="md-headline"># Modeling fitness trend using "Training Stress Balance Model"</h3>

            Fitness trend is based on Training Stress Balance (TSB) model. This model uses the terms Chronic Training Load (CTL) for "fitness", Acute Training
            Load (ATL) for "fatigue" and Training Stress Balance (TSB) for "form/performance". This model has been introduced
            by Andrew Coggan.

            <h4 class="md-title">Fitness (Chronic Training Load, or CTL)</h4>

            Fitness/CTL is the long-term average daily training load. By default period is fixed to 42 days (or six weeks), so it will take ~6 weeks for your Fitness to be accurate.
            CTL is basically "house's foundation", the potential availability of the athlete...
            You can't get into big rides/runs or races without a minimum of fitness acquired. A too regular or too flat
            CTL is not usually a sign of good training.


            <h4 class="md-title">Fatigue (Acute Training Load, or ATL)</h4>

            Fatigue/ATL is the short-term average daily training load. Same way than CTL but default period is fixed to 7 days (one week). Conceptually, fatigue is easy to understand;
            it's that tired feeling which limits your performance.
            This curve varies much faster than CTL. On that curve you can see on days with a workout with a high stress the
            fatigue climbs sharply in response. You do a hard workout today and you will feel it in the coming days. But also go down quickly as you take a few days off.


            <h4 class="md-title">Form (Training Stress Balance, or TSB)</h4>

            Form/TSB is the difference between CTL and ATL: TSB = CTL-ATL<br/><br/>

            - TSB > 0: Athlete in form, sharp or under-training phase.<br/><br/>
            - TSB < 0: Athlete on overload or over-training phase.<br/><br/>

            Note that being fit does not mean that you are ready to race at your best. A negative Form would
            indicate that you are carrying a lot of fatigue and are not on form. However, by resting you can evacuate
            fatigue at a greater rate than you lose fitness and come into form on the day that matters most... Race day
            !
            In short, Fitness minus Fatigue equals Form.
