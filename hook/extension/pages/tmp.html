            ...First of all you need to record heartrate data inside Strava to enjoy these features. Good reading...

            <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;"><u>TR</u>aining <u>IMP</u>ulse or TRIMP:</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>Represents the amount of heart stress during an activity. The longer you ride at full throttle, the more you SCORE !! So go outside suffer for twelve hours! Or stay here to understand what it returns... <i>TRIMP</i> is a way to model the human athletic performance. This concept has been introduced by Dr Eric Banister.
            <br/>
            <br/>Ok, Cool... But how this works?!
            <br/>
            <br/>StravaPlus computes <i>TRIMP</i> on activities using the more sophisticated approach: <i>TRIMP Exponental Heart Rate Scaling</i> which use your <i>Heart Rate Reserve or HRR</i>. <i>HRR</i> is basically your heart effort level according to your heart capacity .
            <br/>
            <br/>What are all theses terms?! Don\'t panic... Here is an explanation from a Math view.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="img/trimp_equation.png" />
            <br/>
            <br/>Where&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <img src="img/kMen_equation.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Mens) &nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <img src="img/kWomen_equation.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Womens)
            <br/>
            <br/>And <i>HRR = Heart Rate Reserve = Heart effort level according to heart capacity</i> defined by
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="img/hrr_equation.png" />
            <br/>
            <br/>According this <i>TRIMP Exponental Heart Rate Scaling</i> formula, the longer you ride at full throttle, the more you SCORE !
            <br/>
            <br/>But this heart score seems to be <i>Strava Suffer Score</i>?! Not really... <i>Strava Suffer Score</i> is only inspired by the TRIMP concept. However the idea is same and both score are correlated.
            <br/>
            <br/>Need more infos? Then read more about <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Heart_Rate_Reserve" target="_blank">HRR here</a> and <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/TRIMP" target="_blank">TRIMP here</a>

            <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">%Heart Rate Reserve Average:</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>Represents the stress level reached during an activity according to your heart capacity. As mentionned into <i><u>TR</u>aining <u>IMP</u>ulse</i> explanation, Heart Rate Reserve is basically a heart effort level according to a heart capacity:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="img/hrr_equation.png" />
            <br/>
            <br/>This indicator is scaled on a complete activity then average heart rate participates to the party.
            <br/>
            <br/>Consequently <i>%Heart Rate Reserve Average</i> is defined by
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="img/hrrAvg_equation.png" />
            <br/>
            <br/>If you ride with a %HRR average of 100% this seems you were at full capacity of your heart during the whole activity. It\'s impossible... But try to get the higher percentage ;) You will get a better <i>TRIMP</i> score in the same way.

            <br/>
            <br/>To display this graph you need heart rate data on your activity. Next hit the link <i>Click to display %HRR Octo Zones Distribution</i> inside activity page. You\'ll get a graph like this:

            <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">Quartiles and median</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>For understanding theses indicators, we assume that 0% to 100% are all the heart rates sorted ascending you obtained during an activity.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>25% Quartile:</strong>This indicator represents the heart rate you maintained at the position "25%". This is commonly called "Lower quartile" or Q1.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>50% Median:</strong>This indicator represents the heart rate you maintained at the position "50%". It\'s simply the median...
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>75% Quartile:</strong>This indicator represents the heart rate you maintained at the position "75%". This is commonly called "Upper quartile" or Q3.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/><i>Theses indicators can be more meaningfull than average heart rate itself to analyse activity heart rate. For example, you upload an activity in which you ride pretty fast for a long time. Then, you expect to have a good average heart rate. Unfortunately, you have to go through the city to go home where many red lights and cars behavior slow you down. Your average heart rate then drops very quickly and do not highlight your effort of "riding fast". In this example, the 75% quartile speed is representative of the effort you made (eliminating low heart rate associated with the cross of the city).</i>
